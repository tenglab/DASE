\arguments{
\item{se_in}{pooled SE bed file of all samples.}

\item{e_in}{pooled enhancer bed file of all samples.}

\item{bl_file}{super-enhancer blacklist bed file download from ENCODE (ENCFF356LFX)}

\item{custom_range}{a vector of extra customized blacklist to ignore.
Format: c(chr:start-end, chr:start-end, ...).}

\item{enhancer_count_table}{raw count file of pooled enhancers}

\item{data_type}{quantitative file format "bam" or "bw" (default=bam)}

\item{spline_fun}{spline functions ("bs", "ns", and "smooth". default=bs)}

\item{permut}{if you want permutation (default=TRUE)}

\item{times}{permutation times (default=10)}

\item{cutoff_v}{fold change lower and upper cutoff vector.
if permutation is used, it will use the value calculated by permutation. (default=c(-1.5,1.5))}

\item{condition_1}{path of bam/bw files for condition 1 replicates, separated by ",".
Example: condition_1="path_to_bam/c1_r1.bam,path_to_bam/c1_r2.bam,...".}

\item{condition_2}{path of bam/bw files for condition 1 replicates, separated by ",".
Example: condition_2="path_to_bam/c2_r1.bam,path_to_bam/c2_r2.bam,...".}

\item{c1_pair}{if replicates of condition 1 is paired-end, separated by ",".
Order need to match with parameter condition_1.
Example: c1_pair="FALSE(or F),TRUE(or T),...". (only available for bam file)}

\item{c2_pair}{if replicates of condition 1 is paired-end, separated by ",".
Order need to match with parameter condition_2.
Example: c2_pair="FALSE(or F),TRUE(or T),...". (only available for bam file)}

\item{c1_n}{number of replicates (samples) in condition 1 (only available for raw count table).}

\item{c2_n}{number of replicates (samples) in condition 2 (only available for raw count table).}
}
\value{
The output of DASE is a list with multiple data types including:

lfc_shrink: a shrinking lfc object from \emph{DESeq2} for all enhancers. It can be used to creat MA plot
cutoff: significant threshold for fitted log2 fold changes.
density_plot: a density plot of permutation and original fitted log2 fold changes, if \emph{permut=T}.
boxplot: a boxplot of final SE categories
se_category: a data frame containing final SE categories
pattern_list: a list containing figures for each SE pattern
ce_fit: a data frame containing DESeq2 output and spline-fitted log2 fold change of all constitute enhancers

Each column in se_category represents:\cr

se_merge_name: name of merged SE,"chr_start_end".\cr
total_width: width of merged SE (unit=k).\cr
number_enhancer: number of CEs in each SE.\cr
category: SE category identified by \emph{DASE}.\cr
direction: enrichment direction of SEs (none:Other or non-differential category;
+: enriched in sample 2; -: enriched in sample 1;
l: sample 1 shifted in 5' direction; r: sample 2 shifted in 5' direction).
non_mid_percent: total activity occupancy of the segments that go beyond the threshold cutoffs.\cr
mean_FC: mean of log2 SE coverage fold change.\cr
rank: SE category ranking based on non_mid_percent first and mean_FC for each SE category.
(rank=1 means the most changed in the corresponding SE category.)\cr

Each column in ce_fit represents:\cr

e_merge_name: name of merged CEs.\cr
chr: chromosome of CEs.\cr
start: start posation of CEs.\cr
end: end posation of CEs.\cr
width: width of CEs.\cr
C1_\emph{: coverage of condition 1 replicate \}.\cr
C2_\emph{: coverage of condition 2 replicate \}.\cr
C1_\emph{_norm: normalized coverage of condition 1 replicate \}.\cr
C2_\emph{_norm: normalized coverage of condition 2 replicate \}.\cr
baseMean: normalized coverage mean of all samples.\cr
log2FoldChange: log2 fold change of normalized coverage.\cr
lfcSE: log2 fold change standard error.\cr
stat: statistic of log2 fold change.\cr
pvalue: p-value of log2 fold change.\cr
padj: adjusted p-value of log2 fold change.\cr
baseMean_shrink: shrinkage of normalized coverage mean of all samples.\cr
log2FoldChange_shrink: shrinkage of log2 fold change.\cr
lfcSE_shrink: shrinkage of log2 fold change standard error.\cr
pvalue_shrink: shrinkage of log2 fold change p-value.\cr
padj_shrink: shrinkage of log2 fold change adjusted p-value.\cr
se_merge_name: merged SE names.\cr

\description{
A function to get the category and ranking of SEs in one step
}
\details{
This function is the main function used to get the category and ranking of SEs.
The workflow of this function is "SEfilter -> enhancerFoldchange -> SEfitspline -> SEpattern -> SEcategory"
